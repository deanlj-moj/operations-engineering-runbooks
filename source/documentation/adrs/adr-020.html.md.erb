# ADR-020 Fine-grained Personal Access Token Standards

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

The Operations Engineering (OE) team at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) need a standard
way to use Personal Access Tokens (PATs) in the moj-operations-engineering-bot account
so that we can reduce risks, improve clarity, and align with best practices in token management.

## Decision

For tokens created in the the moj-operations-engineering-bot account we have agreed;

- To use Fine-grained PATs (FG-PATs) where possible in accordance with industry standards and GitHub recommendations.
- To name the FG-PAT descriptively, referencing the project where it is used.
- To include in the FG-PAT description field the full organisation/repository, project name, and the GitHub secret name is it used under.
- To only use a token in a single repository. A repository may use more than one token.
- To only enable the minimum permissions required (POLP).
- To set an expiration date of 1 year.



## Consequences

- These standards help to manage our current secrets manually
- Facilitate progress towards managing secrets automatically (storage and regeneration in a secrets manager).
- Supports direction outlined in ADR 019 to enable repository secret management in Terraform.
