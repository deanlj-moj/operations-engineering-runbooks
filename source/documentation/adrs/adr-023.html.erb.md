# ADR-023: Delegate Administration of Outside Collaborators

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

A number of years ago Operations Engineering centrallised the administaion of outside collaborators i.e. users external to MoJ that collaborate/support MoJ projects.

The reasons for this were as follows:

1. **Lack of joiners, leavers and movers process** - Due to a lack or process outside collaborators were often left attached to MoJ repositories even after their work with MoJ had concluded. This gave these users access that they no longer required, and consumed GitHub licences.

2. **Too many GitHub organisation owners** - The organisation at the time had far too many owners which meant that there was a lack of oversight and consistencey around how outside collaborators were added to the organisation, in some cases external users were being added as members, which gave them elevated priviliges and access to internal repositories that they have no reason to access.

To address these problems, Operations Engineering centrallised the process for onboarding outside collaborators, reduced permission for those who could add these type of users, and started [managing collaborators in code](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/github-collaborators), which enabled a greater level of automation of the process.

### Problems

The process has opperated well, but over time a number of new problems have arisen, which has promted us to look at the current solution.

#### Problem - Over complicated process

Over the years additional buisness rules and features have been added that have made the process overly complex and difficult to maintain.

#### Problem - Lack of ruby knowledge

The original code is based on Ruby, and the Team no longer has sufficient Ruby expertise to maintain the existing codebase.

#### Problem - Increase of use of managing users in code

There has been an increase in the number of team that are managing their access and permisions to their own projects in code, which has enabled greater visibility of access and improved management through automation.
