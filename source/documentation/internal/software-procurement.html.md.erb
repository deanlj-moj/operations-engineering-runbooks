#  Software Procurement Processes

This runbook sets out the processes involved in procuring new software or renewing existing software.

This runbook does not cover procurement that would involve a full commercial tender. This is not covered here but will be identified as part of the Demand Process mentioned later, if required.

This runbook does not cover any exceptional process that may vary from the standard Governence processes. Any variation from these process must be in agreement with Head of Hosting, Budget Holder, Finance and Commercial.

## Procurng new software

## Renewing software

The software renewal process is very similar to the process for procuring new software with a few exceptions which are detailed as follows:

### Trigger to renew software

4 months prior to the expiry of the contract you will be contacted by the Software Assesst Management Team (SAM) about your intention to renew a subscription.

If you are intending to renew on the same terms you can confirm that you will renew and request a quote. 

If you requirement is changing at renewal e.g. adding additional licences you will need to go via Demand and Triage as if this was a new request.

### Data Privancy and Impact Assessment

Not require unless:
- A DPIA does not currently exist for the software you are renewing
- A DPIA exists but there has been a change to how the data is processed or held
- A DPIA exists but the type of data held has changed

### Security Assessment

Not required unless:
- Your DPIA was not overseen by MoJâ€™s DPIA approval processes
- There has been a change to how the software is storing data
- There have been changes to the number or type of risks associated with this software

### Spend Controls

As this is a renewal the subscription will already be in the budget. Unless you are making changes to the subscription this will be covered by Delegated Authority process mentioned earlier. Once the delegated Authority form has been completed you can request a PO to be raised via the Finanace Team as per the process above.
