# Testing and Release Process 

This runbook outlines the risk-aware process for testing and releasing changes to third party tools (e.g Github) to ensure reliability of releases and minimise disruptions for users.

## Step 1: Risk Assesment and Planning 

- **Conduct a full risk assesment:** Ensure a thorough assessment for all affected GitHub organizations (ministryofjustice and moj-analytical-services), treating them as equal stakeholders.
- **Include Stakeholders:**  Engage key stakeholders earlier in the release process to discuss the potential impact on users and the functionalities affected by the change. 

## Step 2: Testing Process 

-  **Define Testing Criteria:** Ensure that testing covers all organizations, user types (existing, new) and all users access methods (web UI, CLI)
-  **Create and Document Test:** Cases: Create spreedsheet covering functional and non-functional testing requirements based on the cryteria. 
-  **Conduct Testing in Controlled Environment:** Use a testing environment that mirrors production as closely as possible. Include different type of users from all affected organizations. 
-  **Document Testing Results:** Record the test results in the test spreadsheet and share them with the team for discussion. 

## Step 3: Commununication and User Notification 

-  **Allow a Minimum 24-hour Delay:** Ensure that there is at least a 24-hour gap between the release of the change and the communication. 
-  **Users and Stakeholder Informed:** Notify users and support teams of the planned release, including a summary of expected changes, potential impacts, and support contacts.

## Step 4 Final Approval and Release 

- **Obtain Dual Approval:** Ensure two separate approvals in Slack from the team members before processing with the release 
- **Execute Release:** Implement the change according to the release plan, following the successful completion of all documented steps.
- **Post-Release Monitoring:** Monitor affected systems and user feedback channels to quickly address any issues that may arise.
- **Incident Process for Issues:** If a significant issue occurfollow the Incident Reponse runbook to inform the team and begin problem resolution.
